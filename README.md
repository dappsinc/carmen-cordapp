cd nodes
cd Dapps
rm -rf persistence.mv.db nodeInfo-* network-parameters certificates additional-node-infos

```

```bash

curl -o /var/tmp/network-truststore.jks http://dsoa.network:8080//network-map/truststore

```

3) Initial Node Registration

```bash

java -jar corda.jar --initial-registration --network-root-truststore /var/tmp/network-truststore.jks --network-root-truststore-password trustpass

### CRM Network States

Customer States are transferred between stakeholders on the network.

#### Accounts

The first state to be deployed on the network is the `Account`. Version 0.1 of the `Account` State has the following structure:

```jsx

// *********
// * Account State *
// *********

data class Account(val accountId: String,
                   val accountName: String,
                   val accountType: String,
                   val industry: String,
                   val phone: String,
                   val controller: Party,
                   val processor: Party,
                   override val linearId: UniqueIdentifier = UniqueIdentifier())


```

The Account has the following business `flows` that can be called:

- `CreateAccount` - Create an Account between your organization and a known counterparty on the DSOA
- `TransferAccount` - Transfer the Account between your organization and a counterparty on the DSOA
- `ShareAccount` - Share the Account Data with a counterparty
- `EraseAccount` - Erase the Account Data

#### Contacts

The second state to be deployed on the network is the `Contact`. Version 0.1 of the `Contact` State has the following structure:

```jsx

// *********
// * Contact State *
// *********

data class Contact(val contactId: String,
                   val firstName: String,
                   val lastName: String,
                   val email: String,
                   val phone: String,
                   val controller: Party,
                   val processor: Party,
                   override val linearId: UniqueIdentifier = UniqueIdentifier())


```


The Contact has the following business `flows` that can be called:

- `CreateContact` - Create a Contact between your organization and a known counterparty on the DSOA
- `TransferContact` - Transfer the Contact between your organization and a counterparty on the DSOA
- `ShareContact` - Share the Contact Data with a counterparty
- `EraseContact` - Erase the Contact Data

#### Leads

The third state to be deployed on the network is the `Lead`. Version 0.1 of the `Lead` State has the following structure:

```jsx

// *********
// * Lead State *
// *********

data class Lead(val leadId: String,
                val firstName: String,
                val lastName: String,
                val company: String,
                val title: String,
                val email: String,
                val phone: String,
                val country: String,
                val controller: Party,
                val processor: Party,
                override val linearId: UniqueIdentifier = UniqueIdentifier())


```


The Lead has the following business `flows` that can be called:

- `CreateLead` - Create a Lead between your organization and a known counterparty on the DSOA
- `TransferLead` - Transfer the Lead between your organization and a counterparty on the DSOA
- `ShareLead` - Share the Lead Data with a counterparty
- `EraseLead` - Erase the Lead Data
- `ConvertLead` - Convert a Lead State into an Account State and Contact State


We created the `Carmen Dashboard` to provide the ability for organizations to create `Accounts`, `Contacts`, and `Leads` with counterparties on the network.


#### Cases


```jsx

// *********
// * Case State *
// *********

data class Case(val caseId: String,
                val description: String,
                val caseNumber: String,
                val caseStatus: CaseStatus,
                val casePriority: CasePriority,
                val submitter: Party,
                val resolver: Party,
                override val linearId: UniqueIdentifier = UniqueIdentifier()) 


```

The Case has the following business `flows` that can be called:

- `CreateCase` - Create a Case between your organization and a known counterparty on the DSOA
- `StartCase` - Start on an unstarted Case
- `CloseCase` - Close the Case with a counterparty
- `EscalateCase` - Escalate the Case
